		<p>Welcome to all visitors to this page. I present to your attention my own version of the project on Codecademy, namely "Own cheat sheet". I chose not to accumulate a large amount of tags and information, instead, in addition to the basic information, I provided links to resources that I personally liked and found relevant.</p>

						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Purpose of CSS</a></td>
						<td>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that is used in combination with HTML that customizes how HTML elements will appear. CSS can define styles and change the layout and design of a sheet.</td>

						<td>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that is used in combination with HTML that customizes how HTML elements will appear. CSS can define styles and change the layout and design of a sheet.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Write CSS in Separate Files</a></td>
						<td>CSS code can be written in its own files to keep it separate from the HTML code. The extension for CSS files is .css. These can be linked to an HTML file using a &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Write CSS in HTML File</a></td>
						<td>CSS code can be written in an HTML file by enclosing the code in &lt;style&gt; tags. Code surrounded by &lt;style&gt; tags will be interpreted as CSS syntax.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Inline Styles</a></td>
						<td>CSS styles can be directly added to HTML elements by using the <em>style</em> attribute in the element&apos;s opening tag. Each style declaration is ended with a semicolon. Styles added in this manner are known as <em>inline</em> styles.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Class and ID Selectors</a></td>
						<td>CSS classes can be reusable and applied to many elements. Class selectors are denoted with a period . followed by the class name. CSS ID selectors should be unique and used to style only a single element. ID selectors are denoted with a hash sign # followed by the id name.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Selector Chaining</a></td>
						<td>CSS selectors define the set of elements to which a CSS rule set applies. For instance, to select all  &lt;p&lt; elements, the p selector can be used to create style rules.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Chaining Selectors</a></td>
						<td>CSS selectors can be chained so that rule sets apply only to elements that match all criteria.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">CSS Type Selectors</a></td>
						<td>CSS <em>type selectors</em> are used to match all elements of a given type or tag name. Unlike for HTML syntax, we do not include the angle brackets when using type selectors for tag names. When using type selectors, elements are matched regardless of their nesting level in the HTML.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">HTML attributes with multiple values</a></td>
						<td>Some HTML attributes can have multiple attribute values. Multiple attribute values are separated by a space between each attribute.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">Selector Specificity</a></td>
						<td>Specificity is a ranking system that is used when there are multiple conflicting property values that point to the same element. When determining which rule to apply, the selector with the highest specificity wins out. The most specific selector type is the ID selector, followed by class selectors, followed by type selectors.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">CSS ID selectors</a></td>
						<td>The CSS ID selector matches elements based on the contents of their <em>id </em>attribute. The values of id attribute should be unique in the entire DOM. For selecting the element having job-title as the value of the <em>id</em> attribute, a <em>#</em> needs to be prepended.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/syntax-and-selectors/cheatsheet">CSS descendant selector</a></td>
						<td>The CSS descendant selector combinator is used to match elements that are descended from another matched selector. They are denoted by a single space between each selector and the descended selector. All matching elements are selected regardless of the nesting level in the HTML.</td>
					</tr>
